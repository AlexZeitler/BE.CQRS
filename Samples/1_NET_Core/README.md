In this sample you see how to use DomainObjects and how they are stored with the DomainObject Repository.
You can also retrieve them from the repository.

Also you can see how states of an aggregate e.g. for checks on the write/domain-side are done. These stated are not related to the facts on the read. 
You will see the read side and how denormalizers work in a later example
